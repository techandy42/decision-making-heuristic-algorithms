# Heuristic Algorithms

This repository consists of three different projects:

1) the file, Missionaries_And_Cannibals.java, is a Java program that solves the famous three missionaries and three cannibals problem using loops and conditional statements, and prints out the solution.

2) the three files, Main.java, Bird.java, and Simulation.java, are the three parts of a Java program that simulates the interaction between two different types of objects (hawk - aggressive / dove - peaceful) and graphs the ratio as the generation evolves. It uses evolutionary method to simulate the problem. (Very Cool)

3) the file, tictactoe.py, is a Python program that allows a player to play against a tictactoe bot, which uses recursion and conditional statements to play against the player.
